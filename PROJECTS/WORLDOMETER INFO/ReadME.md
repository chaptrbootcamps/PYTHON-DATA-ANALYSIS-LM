Scrap the data data and plot world statistics and visualize them.
Statistics may include :
- General statistics on the home page
- Population statistics
- Environment stats
- Social Media Statistics

For each statistics, there should be a summary plot and a more detailed trend plot for the subcategories in the statistic
e.g. For population you could have:
- Birth trends internationally or per continent over the last years
- Death trends internationally or per continent over the last years
- Population trends internationally or per continent over the last years

Similarly for Environment and social media statistics etc.

NB: You will have to scrap the site for this data.
