Given the rise in use of data and the proliferation of companies such as Google whose business 
models are hinged on the value of user data, regulatory bodies have been forced to implement data 
protection and privacy regulations across the globe, for instance the GDPR, EU based. Locally in 
Kenya we have the Data Protection Act, which is based on the aforementioned. 
Following the implementation  of the GDPR in the EU countries a number of countries have faced 
fines related to different articles violated.
