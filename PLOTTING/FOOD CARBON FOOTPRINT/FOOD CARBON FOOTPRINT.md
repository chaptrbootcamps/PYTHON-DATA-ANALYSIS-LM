# FOOD CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Climate change is at the center of boardroom discussions, on how the increased 
talk and regulation will impact businesses and how they can capitalize on this to 
be sustainable in the future and not treat it as an obstacle to growth. At an individual 
level we also share in the responsibility of making the right decisions that care for 
the future generations. The most effective way of doing this is to stay informed on what 
the major contributors to this 21st century menace is, and thereby make informed choices 
and shape policy. 

In this week's project you will be exploring food carbon emissions- The environmental 
impacts of our eating habits. 
[Food Carbon Footprint Index 2018 | nu3](https://www.nu3.de/blogs/nutrition/food-carbon-footprint-index-2018) Conducted a research on directly comparing different 
diets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The research, which reveals the annual CO2 
emissions per person for 130 nations worldwide, shows which countries could significantly 
reduce their carbon footprint by switching to a plant-based diet, as well as which food 
types generate the highest carbon dioxide emissions.

You will use this [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv) to explore the following:
- The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries 
(Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERSiKrBUcAACMrL?format=png&name=900x900)
- Highlight the marked difference between consumption and emissions in certain food 
product of your choice 
- The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon 
footprint. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERSiKrBUcAACMrL?format=png&name=900x900)
- Beef's contribution to CO2 emissions (kg/person/year) - Map this. 
- A box plot and interpretation of the CO2 contributions of food levels. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROivo7UYAAygul?format=jpg&name=small) as inspiration 
- Top 10 Countries with highest emissions. Choose the appropriate visual type. Get inspiration from this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERFZGueW4AEEwSo?format=png&name=large) 
- Use all your data to write a 500 words minimum of insights and the story behind your exploration. 
- Alternatively compile a set of slides with your insights.
