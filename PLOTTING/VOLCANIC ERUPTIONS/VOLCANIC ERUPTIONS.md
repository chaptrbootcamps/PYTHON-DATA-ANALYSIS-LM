Volcano eruptions can affect the global climate, a [Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14565#Sec26) 
has open-access data for a specific time-period of eruptions along with temperature anomalies 
and tree growth. More details can be found from [NASA](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/volcanoes-and-climate-change) 
and the [UCAR](https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/how-volcanoes-influence-climate). A summary of the pay-walled 
Nature article can be found via the [Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/sixth-century-misery-tied-not-one-two-volcanic-eruptions-180955858/)

The researchers detected 238 eruptions from the past 2,500 years, they report today in Nature. 
About half were in the mid- to high-latitudes in the northern hemisphere, while 81 were in the tropics. 
(Because of the rotation of the Earth, material from tropical volcanoes ends up in both Greenland and 
Antarctica, while material from northern volcanoes tends to stay in the north.) The exact sources of 
most of the eruptions are as yet unknown, but the team was able to match their effects on climate to 
the tree ring records.

The analysis not only reinforces evidence that volcanoes can have long-lasting global effects, but it 
also fleshes out historical accounts, including what happened in the sixth-century Roman Empire. 
The first eruption, in late 535 or early 536, injected large amounts of sulfate and ash into the atmosphere. 
According to historical accounts, the atmosphere had dimmed by March 536, and it stayed that way for 
another 18 months.

Tree rings, and people of the time, recorded cold temperatures in North America, Asia and Europe, where 
summer temperatures dropped by 2.9 to 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit below the average of the previous 30 years. 
Then, in 539 or 540, another volcano erupted. It spewed 10 percent more aerosols into the atmosphere than 
the huge eruption of Tambora in Indonesia in 1815, which caused the infamous “year without a summer”. 
More misery ensued, including the famines and pandemics. The same eruptions may have even contributed to a 
decline in the Maya empire, the authors say.
